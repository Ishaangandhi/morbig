(**specification

   [Assignment preceding command name]

   [When the first word]

   If the TOKEN does not contain the character '=', rule 1 is
   applied. Otherwise, 7b shall be applied.

   [Not the first word]

   If the TOKEN contains the <equals-sign> character:

   If it begins with '=', the token WORD shall be returned.

   If all the characters preceding '=' form a valid name (see XBD
   Name), the token ASSIGNMENT_WORD shall be returned. (Quoted
   characters cannot participate in forming a valid name.)

   Otherwise, it is unspecified whether it is ASSIGNMENT_WORD or WORD
   that is returned.

   Assignment to the NAME shall occur as specified in Simple Commands.
