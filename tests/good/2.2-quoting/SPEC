2.2 Quoting

Quoting is used to remove the special meaning of certain characters or
words to the shell. Quoting can be used to preserve the literal
meaning of the special characters in the next paragraph, prevent
reserved words from being recognized as such, and prevent parameter
expansion and command substitution within here-document processing
(see Here-Document).

The application shall quote the following characters if they are to
represent themselves:

|  &  ;  <  >  (  )  $  `  \  "  '  <space>  <tab>  <newline>

and the following may need to be quoted under certain
circumstances. That is, these characters may be special depending on
conditions described elsewhere in this volume of POSIX.1-2008:

*   ?   [   #   Ëœ   =   %

The various quoting mechanisms are the escape character,
single-quotes, and double-quotes. The here-document represents another
form of quoting; see Here-Document.
